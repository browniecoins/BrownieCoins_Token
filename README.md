The Brownie Coins Protocol is a community driven, fair launched DeFi Token. Three simple functions occur during each trade: Reflection, LP Acquisition, and Burn.

##Community Driven
Community driven & fair launch. The dev team burned all of their tokens and participated with everyone else.
##Automatic LP
Every trade contributes towards automatically generating liquidity that goes into multiple pools used by exchanges
##RFI Static Rewards
Holders earn passive rewards through static reflection as they watch their balance of SafeMoon grow indefinitely.
