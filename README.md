The Brownie Coins Protocol is a community driven, fair launched DeFi Token. Three simple functions occur during each trade: Reflection, LP Acquisition, and Burn.

Community Driven

Community driven & fair launch. The dev team burned all of their tokens and participated with everyone else.

Automatic LP

Every trade contributes towards automatically generating liquidity that goes into multiple pools used by exchanges

RFI Static Rewards

Holders earn passive rewards through static reflection as they watch their balance of SafeMoon grow indefinitely.
